*WORK IN PROGRESS*

AbstractGL is an OpenGL API wrapper aiming at facilitating learning and writing modern OpenGL.

This aim is achieved through the following:

**Deprecating older functions.**
The OpenGL core profile presents 100+ functions which can be very daunting to beginners.
A lot of these functions are redundant.
It is also the case that many advanced users are not aware of newer functions that they should instead use.

**Better typing.**

**Better interfaces.** 

**GLSL types.** 

**Utilitaties.**
